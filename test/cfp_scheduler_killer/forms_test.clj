  "The form builder.

   Four properties carry this namespace, and every one of them is a NEGATIVE —
   the failure mode is silent corruption of history, not a broken page:

     1. A field id, once minted, never moves. Renaming a label must not re-key.
     2. Removing a field is RETIRING it. Nothing is erased, because stored
        answers reference the id forever.
     3. Locked fields cannot be removed at all.
     4. Re-folding the log alone reproduces the edited form exactly — otherwise
        the projection and the store have quietly diverged."
