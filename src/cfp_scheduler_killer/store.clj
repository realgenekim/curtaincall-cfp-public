  "Append-only, event-sourced store. THE LOG IS THE DATABASE.

   Every mutation appends one JSON line to data/store/events.jsonl and folds
   that same event into an in-memory atom. Nothing is ever updated in place and
   nothing is ever deleted: 'remove' is an event too. Current state is DERIVED
   by replaying the log from the beginning, so the full history — what changed,
   when, by whom — is always recoverable.

   Lineage: hl7_recode/store.py (arkana-cfo) — append event JSONL, derive state
   by folding, history always recoverable — plus the typed {at, type, actor,
   payload} event shape we were already writing to events_log.

   WHY JSONL BY DEFAULT: zero setup. `make server-dev` runs with no database
   installed, no container, no connection string. A judge clones the repo and it
   works.

   POSTGRES LIVES BEHIND THIS SAME BOUNDARY (bd 3s1). Set STORE_BACKEND=postgres
   and exactly two functions change — `append-line!` and `read-events` — because
   the abstraction is the same either way: an ORDERED SEQUENCE OF LINES. A file
   of lines, or a table of lines. Everything above the seam (fold, replay,
   time-travel, the security tests that assert the log only grows) is untouched
   and cannot tell the difference. See cfp-scheduler-killer.store-pg.

   Two rules that keep this honest:
     1. The projection (`state`) is derived and disposable. Never write to the
        atom except through `fold-event`. Delete the atom, reload the file, get
        the identical state.
     2. Payloads are COMPLETE. The event carries every field needed to rebuild
        the row, because there is no other table to join against later."
