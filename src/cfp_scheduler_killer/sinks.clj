;; review "came to you". A New Proposal email carried the FULL proposal inline —
;; every custom field, the speaker bio, the private notes — with one orange
;; button. The committee read it over coffee, in their inbox, and the review
;; started there. Every tool since has sent "a new submission was received.
;; Log in to view it", and every one of them lost the committee to Slack.
;;
;; So this mail is deliberately long. The private notes-to-committee IS
;; included: this goes to the programming committee, which is the audience that
;; field was written for. It is the one place that answer belongs.

;; Slack and finishes on the board.
;;
;; Two rules shape everything below:
;;
;;   1. NO PRIVATE ANSWERS, EVER. A Slack channel is a wider audience than the

;;      messages here carry title / speaker / org / format and nothing else from
;;      the form. The push EMAIL may carry the private note because its audience
;;      is the committee by construction; a channel is not.
;;   2. COMPACT. This lands in a busy channel. Two blocks, one link, no

;; narrower and deliberately so: it fires ONLY on the transition INTO
;; "Accepted" — a new session is confirmed — and it emails every member of the
;; programming committee for that event.
;;
;; It needs no configuration: the audience is the committee roster, exactly
;; like :pc-push. It is on by default; an event can turn it off with
;; settings :acceptance-email-enabled false, mirroring pc-push-enabled?.
;;
;; FIREWALL: every letter goes through `mail/send!`, NOT ses/postal directly.
;; That is the one send path that (a) renders-without-sending when there is no
;; SMTP/SES, (b) never really sends for a replay-marked event, (c) honours the
;; per-event email mute — and always records a comms.rendered / comms.sent /
;; comms.failed event, so a notification is never silently claimed.
