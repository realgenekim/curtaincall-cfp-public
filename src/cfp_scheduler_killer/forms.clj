  "The CFP form builder — CRUD over the vector of field definitions.

   A form is DATA (docs/design/form-builder.md): one vector of field defs drives
   public rendering, malli validation, the board columns, exports and 'copy from
   last year'. This namespace is the only thing allowed to change that vector,
   and every change is an appended `form.updated` event carrying the COMPLETE
   new vector — so re-folding the log alone reproduces the edited form exactly.

   Four rules from the design doc are enforced HERE, not in the UI:

     1. **Field IDs are forever.** `mint-field-id` derives a kebab id from the
        label ONCE, at add time, and uniquifies it against every id the form has
        ever carried (retired fields included). Renaming a label never re-keys —
        `update-field!` cannot write :id, so answers keyed by that id keep
        meaning for the life of the conference.

     2. **Deleting is RETIRING.** Old submissions reference field ids, so an
        erased field would orphan their answers. `retire-field!` sets
        `:retired true`; the field stops being collected (see `active-fields`)
        and stops rendering on the public page, and every stored answer stays
        readable against the submission's own snapshot.

     3. **Locked fields are undeletable.** Talk title, abstract and the speaker
        block are the spine of the product; retiring them would leave a CFP that
        cannot describe a talk.

     4. **The type is fixed at birth.** Editing a field changes its label, help,
        options, limits and flags — never its :type or :id. Changing the type
        under stored answers is how a form builder corrupts its own history."
