  "Immutable creation-time form templates: a generic conference default plus
   the EAIS Charlotte demo form transcribed from docs/design/form-builder.md.

   A form is a VECTOR OF FIELD DEFINITIONS, as data (EDN here, JSONB in
   Postgres). One definition drives public rendering, malli validation, board
   columns, exports and 'copy from last year'.

   Design rules that this data encodes (form-builder.md):
     1. Field IDs are FOREVER. Labels rename freely; never re-key.
     2. `:locked true`  — core field, cannot be deleted by the builder UI.
     3. `:private true` — PC-only; never shown on the public page or exports.
     4. `:required` is a per-field toggle, not a type.
     5. Submissions snapshot these defs, so mid-CFP edits can't corrupt old rows."
