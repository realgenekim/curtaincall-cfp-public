  "Import a speaker's details from their public Sessionize profile.

   This is the defection feature: a speaker who already keeps a Sessionize
   profile pastes its URL and their name, tagline, bio, headshot and links land
   in our form. Switching costs are what keep incumbents alive — so we read
   theirs and ask for nothing twice.

   Strictly READ-ONLY: no login, no API key, only the same public HTML a browser
   would get, and it writes NOTHING to the database (no events_log row — an
   import is not a mutation, it just fills a form the speaker has not submitted
   yet).

   PARSING is separated from FETCHING on purpose: `parse-profile` takes an HTML
   string, so the tests run against a saved fixture and never touch the network."
