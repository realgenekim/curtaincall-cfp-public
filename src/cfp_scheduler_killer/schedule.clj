  "The blocking sheet, with superpowers.

   The design evidence (docs/research/blocking-sheet-scheduler.md): ITRev had
   BusyConf's drag-and-drop grid for three years and STILL ran scheduling in a
   Google Sheet called 'Schedule Blocking', pinned every year from 2016. The
   scheduling never happened in the CFP tool. It happened in Sheets.

   Why: schedule BUILDERS demand complete data — a session cannot exist on the
   grid without a room and a time. Schedule BUILDING is a negotiation full of
   partial states: 'maybe Tuesday', 'keynote TBD', 'one of these three, pending
   confirm'. Spreadsheets tolerate ambiguity; grids force premature commitment.

   So three rules run through this namespace:

     1. **Partial states are first-class.** A session may be placed with NO room
        (`:room-id nil`) — swyx does exactly this: 'usually initial cal invite
        has no details then we assign room later'. Unroomed is a column, not an
        error.
     2. **Conflicts are chips, never validation errors.** Every save succeeds.
        We compute the collisions and name them — who, where, when — and offer
        the fix. A tool that refuses the save just sends the work back to Sheets.
     3. **Slot arithmetic is automatic.** Jess and Ann computed 'we've filled 27
        slots and have 30 remaining' by hand in Slack every August. That is a
        `count`."
