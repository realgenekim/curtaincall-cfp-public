  "The replay simulator — three weeks of a CFP, compressed into a minute.

   This is a demo device, and it earns its place by being HONEST about what it
   is: it does not fake a screen. It plays a scripted corpus **through the real
   mutation functions** — `submissions/create-submission!`, `reviews/set-rating!`,
   `reviews/add-comment!`, `reviews/set-status!` — so every row that appears on
   the board got there the same way a real one would, and the Log afterwards is
   indistinguishable from a real CFP's.

   If replaying broke, the app would be broken too. That is the point.

   THE GUARD: replay only ever runs into an event that the replay page itself
   created (`:replay? true` in its settings). A demo that could pollute a real
   conference's data is not a demo, it is a hazard."
