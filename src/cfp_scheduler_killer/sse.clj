  "SSE infrastructure — Datastar HTML fragment push to connected browsers.

   Ported from joe-payne-app's esr-dashboard.sse, including the lesson that
   produced it: push is performed OFF the request thread. All fan-out writes go
   through a single-threaded `push-agent` via `send-off`, so an http-kit worker
   returns immediately and one slow/half-dead client can never block it. Writing
   to every subscriber synchronously on the caller's thread starved http-kit's
   small worker pool there, and unrelated POSTs started returning 503.

   Serializing ALL writes (pushes AND heartbeats) through the one agent also
   means we never call `patch-elements!` on the same sse-gen from two threads at
   once. Every push carries the FULL current fragment (idempotent), so a client
   that drops and reconnects just re-paints the truth.

   One addition over the original: subscribers are tagged with the event they
   are watching, so a rating on one conference never fans out to a committee
   looking at another."
